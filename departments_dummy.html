  <p>The Chemical Engineering Department was established in the year 1996 and was thrice accredited by NBA in 2003, 2008 and 2016. The Department offers UG.
</p>
 <p>

The faculty have good academic and industrial background, and are actively engaged in teaching, research and industrial interaction. Presently, out of the 14 faculty members, 9 are Ph. D holders and two pursuing Ph.D. About 42 papers have been published in the last 3 years in various international and national journals. The faculty is have research interests relating to Microfluidics, Multi Objective Optimization, Three Phase Fluidization, Fuel Cell, Process control, Membrane separations, Bio Fouling, essential oils, precursors for carbon fibers and synthesis of Nano particles.

 </p>
<p>
The department has completed an AICTE – RPS project worth Rs 20 Lakhs and two AICTE – MODROBS projects worth Rs 20 Lakhs in the last 5 years. A collaborative DST funded project on ‘Anti Fouling paint failure in ocean going vessels’ with the Indian Maritime University, Visakhapatnam. Another AICTE – RPS project on ‘Production of Mesophase Pitch suitable for making carbon fibers from Coal Tar’ has been completed and mesophase pitch with 70% mesophase content suitable for carbon fibers was successfully produced in the lab.

 
</p>
<p>
The department is also training the students on the application of software for Chemical Engineering like COMSOL for CFD, PRO II for Chemical Process simulation, MATLAB for general simulations and a Real Time Simulator. The students of the department are regularly trained on these softwares so as to enable them in visualizing the various possible scenarios. This has helped many of the students getting offers from companies like FLUENT, RELIANCE, HPCL, BPCL, INVENSYS and also being offered 10 summer fellowships in IITs and IISc in the last 3 years.

 </p>
<p>
The department has established a strong industry interaction by the Training Technical Service personnel of HPCL on HYSYS, MACRED INDIA employees in the basics of Chemical Engineering. It is also actively engaged in helping purify industrial solvents of local chemical companies. Training program for VASUDHA Pharma Chem employees was organized in chemical engineering unit operations. The department had also signed MOU with JENGU Water Pvt Ltd. and established RO based pilot desalination plant.

 
</p><p>
One of the projects carried out by the UG students was awarded the best project of GVP- College of Engineering (A) by TCS and a patent was published for the “Mosquito Repellent” in 2017.

 </p>
<p>
The Department has full-fledged and well established Process Simulation Lab, Chemical Engineering Laboratories like Heat Transfer, Mass Transfer, Chemical Reaction, Process control, Mechanical unit operations, Fluid mechanics and Chemical Technology which meet the requirements of the undergraduate curriculum. Apart from these regular Labs, the department has also setup a Simulation lab which imparts the students with the knowledge and experience on process simulation, real time control of Distillation Column, Absorber & Stirred Tank Reactor, CFD, Process simulation using PRO-II and MATLAB. The post graduate labs is well equipped with a high pressure PARR reactor, Gas Chromatograph, UV-Spectrophotometer, AAS, Photo catalytic reactor, Auto clave, Controlled CSTR and Distillation Column and other equipment to carry out testing of pollutants.</p>

The department has completed an AICTE – RPS project worth Rs 20 Lakhs and two AICTE – MODROBS projects worth Rs 20 Lakhs in the last 5 years. A collaborative DST funded project on ‘Anti Fouling paint failure in ocean going vessels’ with the Indian Maritime University, Visakhapatnam. Another AICTE – RPS project on ‘Production of Mesophase Pitch suitable for making carbon fibers from Coal Tar’ has been completed and mesophase pitch with 70% mesophase content suitable for carbon fibers was successfully produced in the lab.

 
</p>
<p>
The department is also training the students on the application of software for Chemical Engineering like COMSOL for CFD, PRO II for Chemical Process simulation, MATLAB for general simulations and a Real Time Simulator. The students of the department are regularly trained on these softwares so as to enable them in visualizing the various possible scenarios. This has helped many of the students getting offers from companies like FLUENT, RELIANCE, HPCL, BPCL, INVENSYS and also being offered 10 summer fellowships in IITs and IISc in the last 3 years.

 </p>
<p>
The department has established a strong industry interaction by the Training Technical Service personnel of HPCL on HYSYS, MACRED INDIA employees in the basics of Chemical Engineering. It is also actively engaged in helping purify industrial solvents of local chemical companies. Training program for VASUDHA Pharma Chem employees was organized in chemical engineering unit operations. The department had also signed MOU with JENGU Water Pvt Ltd. and established RO based pilot desalination plant.

<p>
The Department has full-fledged and well established Process Simulation Lab, Chemical Engineering Laboratories like Heat Transfer, Mass Transfer, Chemical Reaction, Process control, Mechanical unit operations, Fluid mechanics and Chemical Technology which meet the requirements of the undergraduate curriculum. Apart from these regular Labs, the department has also setup a Simulation lab which imparts the students with the knowledge and experience on process simulation, real time control of Distillation Column, Absorber & Stirred Tank Reactor, CFD, Process simulation using PRO-II and MATLAB. The post graduate labs is well equipped with a high pressure PARR reactor, Gas Chromatograph, UV-Spectrophotometer, AAS, Photo catalytic reactor, Auto clave, Controlled CSTR and Distillation Column and other equipment to carry out testing of pollutants.</p>
